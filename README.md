This framework supports biofeedback of application users for the
Android/RemixOS platform. Its main objective is to enable new applications to offer online monitoring functionality of users' attention and expressions. Through the analysis of the data obtained from the camera embedded in a computer system, the framework is able to provide resources that allow the recognition of patterns about the behavior and / or emotions captured during the execution of some activities.
